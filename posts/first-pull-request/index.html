			<p>I have seen a lot of people online that want tips for anything from where to
find projects on which to contribute to how to find something to fix on those
projects in order to make a pull request. I won&rsquo;t lie, I have been in the same
exact situation before and making the jump is not easy at all.</p>
<h2 id="find-projects-you-are-interested-in">Find projects you are interested in</h2>
<p>Honestly, I think this is the most important part of contributing to FOSS
projects. Find something you are interested in, preferrably a tool you use often
and check the issues that have been opened (if it&rsquo;s a popular project, chances
are there&rsquo;s plenty of unresolved issues). If you pick something you are
interested in you will be easily pushed into working on improving that tool and
learning more about it. If it&rsquo;s something that you also use often, then jumping
straight in to contributing will be easier since you should know pretty well how
it works. Maybe you found an annoying bug that you want to fix&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="try-to-fix-bugs-that-you-have-encountered">Try to fix bugs that you have encountered</h2>
<p>If you encounter a bug on a FOSS tool you use often, try to see if a ticket has
already been opened, if so, ask about directions on how to solve that issue and
someone will probably be kind enough to tell you where to look.</p>
<h2 id="tests-tests-tests">Tests Tests Tests</h2>
<p>Every project needs tests, especially large ones. Most developers don&rsquo;t like
writing them, that&rsquo;s why one of the most popular (gje fjale me te mire ketu)
issues on GitHub is the necessity for tests. Find a project in need of tests,
add some of them. This way you will be helping the project and learn more about
its inner workings in the meantime.</p>
<h2 id="not-only-code">Not only code</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to only write code in order to be helpful though, in fact, there
are lots of other things you can do that most project maintainers are probably
behind with and will be very grateful if you help with:</p>
<h2 id="write-documentation">Write documentation</h2>
<p>Like tests, most developers procrastinate as much as possible on documentation.
That&rsquo;s where you come in (or you should). Try to write some documentation; if
it&rsquo;s a tool you are familiar with then this part should be easy. My first pull
request was a typo fix in the documentation of a project I can&rsquo;t even remember
right now.</p>
<h2 id="translations">Translations</h2>
<p>Most large projects have some sort of internationalization. If you know a
language other than English then you can probably help with translating.</p>
<p>I understand that I did not give a straightforward answer to the question on how
to find FOSS projects to contribute to as a beginner, unfortunately I don&rsquo;t
think there is a one answer to that. The best way to become good at
open source contribution is the same as most activities out there: practice.
Find something you like and head over to the issues and start working!</p>
